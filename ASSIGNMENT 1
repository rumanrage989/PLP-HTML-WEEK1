    <h1>To Kill a Mockingbird</h1>
    <P>
     The story follows Scout Finch, a young girl growing up in the American South. 
     She witnesses the injustice and prejudice faced by her father, Atticus Finch, as he defends a Black man falsely accused of a crime.
     Through Scout's eyes, we see the complexities of race relations and the impact of prejudice on individuals and society.
